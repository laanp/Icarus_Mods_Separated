## Installation Details

### Client (Local) machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

If you are playing multiplayer where one person is hosting, Use the exact same mods
on everyone's PC, or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the hosting player settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

### Dedicated Server machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server and client machine or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

## Known Bugs/Issues/Notes - As of this current release.
### "Pete's Mining Kit"
For some reason there is a "Komodo Bite" modifier state showing, when you hover over the "Pete's Ore Extractor" and "Pete's Ice Borer" with your mouse cursor. 
This does not affect the player, and can be ignored.  All drills will function at higher speeds.

### Teleporter:  
There is a known issue where ocassionally, after you teleport back to a saved destination when you walk over the teleport pad, you will teleport 
and the screen will become pitch black.  Just activate the remote on your hotbar (remember the key), and teleport back to the teleport pad.  
The screen should correct itself, then step off the pad and walk back over it to retry the teleport to the saved location.  
It will usually work the 2nd time you try.

### "Pete's Resource Killer"
If you are using "Pete's Resource Killer" module (1 hit for tree, rocks and ore gathering) - it goes without saying if you are chopping a tree
with your axe, and do not have the Talent "Seasoned Logsman" - the one that auto picks up your wood, you'll end up with wood pieces all over
the place and not in your inventory!  This is expected behaviour.

### "Pete's Lava Cave Lord"
This module, when placed in your envirosuit auxilliary slot, provides immunity to damage from lava, fire, poison & cave pneumonia.
The afflictions will still show on your character status effects, however you will not take any damage. 

### Equipment Retrieval
None of the unbundled equipment will come back with you after you leave the prospect via dropship. 
You need to purchase the kits at the Workshop, before launching any mission, Open World, or Outpost.
