## Installation Details

### Client (Local) machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

If you are playing multiplayer where one person is hosting, Use the exact same mods
on everyone's PC, or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the hosting player settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

### Dedicated Server machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server and client machine or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.


## Known Bugs/Issues/Notes - As of this current release.
### Some of my bundled mods (laanp-BuildersDream & laanp-Combined_QOL) were designed as a bundled standalone mods that affects a number of files, and may not be compatible with Jimk72's Icarus Mod Manager (IMM).
If installing with other mods using the IMM - SOME THINGS MAY NOT WORK! - You may have success merging with other mods using IMM, but do not report these issues as a bug unless you have tested this mod on it's own, with no other mods installed!
Refer to [laanp Mod Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/laanp/Icarus_Mods_Separated/blob/main/laanp_mod_compatibility_matrix.pdf) for a x-ref of laanp mods that can be used together in the game.

### After a Game Update:
It is generally good practice to follow this procedure when the game goes through an update: 
   - After the files have been updated and patched, startup your Icarus game without any mods installed. 
   - Go into character selection, and view the talent/tech trees, then exit the game completely.  
   - Now install the new mods compatible with the week# and play the game.

### Custom Options Interface:
- "Deactivate Cave Worms" only works in single player client mode, Does not work on Dedicated Server.
- "Extinguish Fire" - Does not seem to work on forest fires in both single player & Dedicated Server
- "Clear Foliage" - Don't panic if you accidentally hit this and all your local flora is gone.  It only lasts for your current session.

### Teleporter:  
There is a known issue where ocassionally, after you teleport back to a saved destination when you walk over the teleport pad, you will teleport 
and the screen will become pitch black.  Just activate the remote on your hotbar (remember the key), and teleport back to the teleport pad.  
The screen should correct itself, then step off the pad and walk back over it to retry the teleport to the saved location.  
It will usually work the 2nd time you try. You'll also sometimes be teleported under the graphics mesh, just move around a bit and you will pop back up to the surface. 
If it still doesn't correct itself, hit ESC and click on the "Unstuck" menu option.

### "Pete's Resource Killer"
If you are using "Pete's Resource Killer" module (1 hit for tree, rocks and ore gathering) - it goes without saying if you are chopping a tree
with your axe, and do not have the Talent "Seasoned Logsman" - the one that auto picks up your wood, you'll end up with wood pieces all over
the place and not in your inventory!  This is expected behaviour.

### "Pete's Drill & Beacon Remote"
- On the Prometheus map, the grid line system is inaccurate and due to this, sometimes the Grid locations on the buttons may be off by one grid.
- This is a known bug, and not much I can do about it, till they fix the issue.

### Equipment Retrieval
None of the unbundled equipment will come back with you after you leave the prospect via dropship. 
You need to purchase the kits at the Workshop, before launching any mission, Open World, or Outpost.

## laanp Mod Compatibility Matrix
The [laanp Mod Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/laanp/Icarus_Mods_Separated/blob/main/laanp_mod_compatibility_matrix.pdf) is a pdf that will provide a visual x-ref of all of my separated mods, and the json files each affect. 

### How to use this matrix:
- Scan for your mod name in leftmost column and note the marked columns to the right showing associated json files that are affected. If any other mod is affecting the same file, then those mods are not compatible with the mod you have selected.

### For example:
- I scan for "laanp_LargerDropShipSlots" in leftmost column, and look across to the marked column of the json file affected.  In this case "D_InventoryInfo.json" is being affected.  But I also observe that my main "laanp-Combined_QOL_v1_w82" mod is also affecting this file, so the 2 mods are not compatible running together.  

## Disclaimer
I have been playing with these mods for quite some time now, with no problems... having said that:
- Backup and save all user data before installing or using any mods.
- Use at your own risk.
- This mod was designed as standalone, and may not be compatible with other mods.
- Ensure you are running the latest version of this mod with the latest version of Icarus.  Hint: the _w77_ in the mod file name means mod is compatible 
    with Week 77 Icarus release.  The _v1...2 etc in the mod file name refers to mod enhancements or fixes within the same week release. 
- This mod changes storage cabinets & bench inventory slot sizes.  
   If you fill all slots in these benches/storage cabinets on a prospect and return to it without these mods running, you will lose
   all those items in those additional slots. 
- Feel free to drop me any ideas for mod changes/suggestions.
- Feel free to re-distribute this mod provided recipients are directed to this Readme for mod credits and are aware of this Disclaimer and Known Bugs
- Feel free to unpack and reassemble with your modding tools, but if repacking and distributing, remove my "laanp" name from any distribution material,
   and make sure you acknowledge credit to any contributing modders.
