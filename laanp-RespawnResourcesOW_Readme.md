## Mod Details:
Steps to reset all resources for Open World prospects: 
1. Place the file "laanp-RespawnResourcesOW_vx_wYY_P.pak" into the mods folder for your game at:
   (drive)\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods
   If the \mods directory does not exist, create it.

2. Restart the game, all resources should have respawned in your OW prospect, wait a save cycle, exit the game, then 
   remove this mod Pak file from the \mods directory.  Now you can restart the game and play with all resources replenished!

3. You can repeat this process as many times as you want for all of your Open World prospects.
