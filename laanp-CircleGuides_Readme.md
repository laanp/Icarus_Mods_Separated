----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mod Version: 1

Compatible with Icarus Version: Rev. 2.2.13.125172 (Week: 138)

## Description:
New craftable building parts that assist with vertical beam placement for circular buildings.

## Mod Details:
- Parts are designed as "miter box" configuration that assists in more precise positioning of vertical beams in free placement mode.
- Visible beam marker cross, and half-wall guides provide angle and height control of vertical beams.  
- Craftable at the character level (for free), the following building parts:
  - "Pete's Circle Build Guides" - Pre-placed guides for 6,8,12,16,24,36,48-sided circular buildings 
  - "Pete's Wall Offset Angle Guides" - Used for right-side placement on vertical beams at the wall location, for setup of next vertical beam placement.
  - "Pete's Direct Angle Guides" - Used for any-side placement on vertical beams to create a new angle.
- Once the build item is deployed, hit the 'R' key for available variations. - Use these tools to build your next circular building!
- Build a 4 x 4 platform and deploy these templates, then install vertical beams on each guide template and build out from there. 
- For 36 & 48-sided buildings, recommend a flat area with 6 x 6 floor base. 
- Delete the templates once all beams have been placed.


## Installation Details

### Client (Local) machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

If you are playing multiplayer where one person is hosting, Use the exact same mods
on everyone's PC, or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the hosting player settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

### Dedicated Server machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server and client machine or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.
