## Mod Details:
- While pointing at any vertical beam, with a another deployed, right-mouse button to bring up "Pete's Circle Builder" Menu.

- Check out the "How-To-Use" video here: [Icarus Mod Tutorial - Pete's Circle Builder](https://youtu.be/SJcZWr_o7Ss?si=FZMb4t0TDTvUwx1F)


Multiplayer Notes:
------------------
- If you are locked on grid, hit the `Home` key to enter free placement, which is needed for building the vertical beams.
- In single player, the mod will automatically place the beams in free placement mode, but in Multiplayer, you need to 
     explicitly toggle the auto grid lock to free placement after placing a beam using the menu.  
- In Multiplayer, there is a significant delay (about > 1 second) after hitting `home` key to see the ghost build piece
     in free placement mode.  This is normal and not caused by the mod. "AutoBuid" feature not available in multiplayer. 


## Installation Details

### Client (Local) machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

If you are playing multiplayer where one person is hosting, Use the exact same mods
on everyone's PC, or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the hosting player settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

### Dedicated Server machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server and client machine or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.
