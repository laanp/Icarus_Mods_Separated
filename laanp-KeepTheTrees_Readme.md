## Installation Details

### Client (Local) machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

If you are playing multiplayer where one person is hosting, Use the exact same mods
on everyone's PC, or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the hosting player settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

### Dedicated Server machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server and client machine or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.
