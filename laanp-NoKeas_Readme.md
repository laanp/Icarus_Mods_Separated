## laanp-NoKeas_v1_w84_P.pak

Mod Version: 1

Compatible with Icarus Version: Rev. 1.3.6.113408 - (Week: 84)

## Description:
Disables spawning of Keas (big parrot-like birds)

## Mod Details:
- While I like to use these annoying birds as target practice, they have this annoying habit of spawning either directly in, 
  or under my base structures (especially when building higher bases).
- This mod removes them from the maps entirely.
