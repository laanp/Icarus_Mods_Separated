laanp-NoKeas_v1_w155_P.pak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mod Version: 1

Compatible with Icarus Version: Rev. 2.2.30.130308 (Week: 155)

## Description:
Disables spawning of Keas (big parrot-like birds)

## Mod Details:
- While I like to use these annoying birds as target practice, they have this annoying habit of spawning either directly in, 
  or under my base structures (especially when building higher bases).
- This mod removes them from the maps entirely.
