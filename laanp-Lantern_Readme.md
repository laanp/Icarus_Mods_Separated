## Installation Details

### Client (Local) or Single Player machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

### Hosted Multiplayer or Dedicated Server:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder typically located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server (or hosted PC) and all client machines connected or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.


## Disclaimer
- Backup and save all user data before installing or using any mods, including prospect files!
- Use mods at your own risk.
- If you want to use multiple mods, you MUST use Jimk72's Icarus Mod Manager (IMM for short) software utility to merge the mods into a single consolidated merged mod file (*._P.pak).
  (yes, you might dispute this, and got lucky stuff worked in the past, but unless you know exactly what you are doing, follow this rule)  
- Ensure you are running the latest version of this mod with the latest version of Icarus.  Hint: the _w175_ in the mod file name means mod is compatible with Week 175 Icarus release.  
  The _v1...2 etc in the mod file name refers to mod enhancements or fixes within the same week release. 
- Some mods change inventory/bench/storage cabinets slot sizes, as well as slot stack sizes.  
  If you have a prospect with these mods running, and had filled extra slot capacities in your inventory/bench/storage cabinets, be warned that loading this prospect without the mods will result in some lost material and resources. 
- Feel free to drop me any ideas for mod changes/suggestions, or custom mod requests.

- Feel free to unpack and reassemble with your own modding tools, but if repacking and distributing, remove my "laanp" or "Pete's" name from any distribution material,
   and make sure you acknowledge credit to any contributing modders.
