----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mod Version: 1

Compatible with Icarus Version: Rev. 2.2.39.132249 (Week: 164)

## Description:
Combines Beacon Teleporter and RemoteDrillAccess into one handheld unit that allow the player to teleport to any portable beacon on the map, as well as remotely communicate and control Deep Mining Drills that have been deployed on the map.  Additional resource locator button allows map scanning and marking of resource deposits. 

## Mod Details:
- Introduces a new handheld device called "Pete's Drill & Beacon Remote" which when crafted in the character inventory, provides the following equipment:
  -  (1) remote
  -  (10) Portable Beacons
  -  (3) Pete's Mining Kit (revised) that contains:
     - (6) "Pete's Nuclear Extractor" - Custom self-powered exotic (purple) extractors
     - (10) "Pete's Ore Extractor" - Custom self-powered ore extractors
     - (3) "Pete's Ice Borer" - Custom self-powered Super-Cooled Ice Borer
     - (3) "Pete's Water Borer" - Custom self-powered Water Borer (with double the extraction speed)
     - (3) "Pete's Portable Water Tanks" - Water Tank with 500L water capacity, of Purified Water!
     - (1) "Pete's Exotic Harvester" - Custom self-powered exotic (red) harvester
     - (10) Portable Beacons - To mark your mining equipment on the map
     - All custom extractors/harvestor/borers are modified for quick extraction
     - They can be carried & stacked in regular inventory (not in the G-slot)

- Once the handheld tool is activated in the quickbar, use LMB to scan the map for existing deployed drills, which will bring up a button list identifying the grid location, 
  type of drill, and resource currently mining at that location.  Click on the button to access drill inventory or optionally teleport to drill.
- Use RMB to bring up the Portable Beacon button list with currently deployed beacon names (with grid locations), which you can click to teleport to that portable beacon 
  location on the map. 
- Clicking on the "Resources" button will bring up an additional window to search for specific resources on the map.
- This mod in single player mode only.   
- Drill inventory access will not work in hosted multiplayer & dedicated server.  
- Resource search radius can impact game performance (for example: setting to 0 for whole map, selecting All, and clicking on "Update Map"), so limit to 2-5 grid size and a 
  selected resource.   
- This mod also allows you to carry all drills in inventory (no more G-slot!), increases drill stack size and significantly reduces drill weights.


## Installation Details

### Client (Local) machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

If you are playing multiplayer where one person is hosting, Use the exact same mods
on everyone's PC, or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the hosting player settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

### Dedicated Server machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server and client machine or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.
