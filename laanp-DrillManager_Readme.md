A unique handheld device that allows the player to remotely communicate and control deployed Resource Drills, teleport to their location, as well as teleport to any deployed portable beacon on the map. 

## Mod Details:
- Now compatible with: single player, hosted multiplayer & dedicated server (See Known Issues below)
- Introduces a new handheld device called "Pete's Drill & Beacon Remote" which when crafted in the character inventory, provides (1) remote, (20) Portable Beacons, and (3) "Pete's Mining Kit".
- Once the handheld tool is activated in the quickbar:
  - Click LMB and to scan the map for deployed resource drills, and provide a list of buttons showing grid location, resource type, and type of drill.
  - Click RMB and to scan the map for deployed Portable Beacons, and provide a list of buttons showing grid location, and Portable Beacon Name.
- Includes a "Resource Locator" to scan the map for resources and mark them on the map.
- This mod also allows you to carry all drills in inventory (no more G-slot!), increases drill stack size and significantly reduces drill weights.
- Includes (3) sets of "Pete's Mining Kit" - that when unbundled, contains the following:
     - (6) "Pete's Nuclear Extractor" - Custom self-powered exotic (purple) extractors
     - (10) "Pete's Ore Extractor" - Custom self-powered ore extractors
     - (3) "Pete's Ice Borer" - Custom self-powered Super-Cooled Ice Borer

## Known Issues:
- On the Prometheus map, the grid line system is inaccurate and due to this, sometimes the Grid locations on the buttons may be off by one grid.
- This is a known bug, and not much I can do about it.
- In multiplayer only, the player cannot remotely access drills that are outside of a 1 grid radius from player location.  This is indicated by the red text on the buttons. Player can still teleport to the drill.
- In multiplayer only, the Resource Locator will only detect Deep Mining resources up to 2 grids from player.  The exception is Water Geysers and Exotic deposits which will show when scanning the whole map.
- Showing all resources on a map (entering 0 in the grid search radius) will introduce considerable lag (in single player) in the game, since you will be marking > 600 locations on your map! Best practice is to select a resource first before changing grid search distance.
   

## Installation Details

### Client (Local) or Single Player machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

### Hosted Multiplayer or Dedicated Server:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder typically located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server (or hosted PC) and all client machines connected or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.


## Disclaimer
- Backup and save all user data before installing or using any mods, including prospect files!
- Use mods at your own risk.
- If you want to use multiple mods, you MUST use Jimk72's Icarus Mod Manager (IMM for short) software utility to merge the mods into a single consolidated merged mod file (*._P.pak).
  (yes, you might dispute this, and got lucky stuff worked in the past, but unless you know exactly what you are doing, follow this rule)  
- Ensure you are running the latest version of this mod with the latest version of Icarus.  Hint: the _w175_ in the mod file name means mod is compatible with Week 175 Icarus release.  
  The _v1...2 etc in the mod file name refers to mod enhancements or fixes within the same week release. 
- Some mods change inventory/bench/storage cabinets slot sizes, as well as slot stack sizes.  
  If you have a prospect with these mods running, and had filled extra slot capacities in your inventory/bench/storage cabinets, be warned that loading this prospect without the mods will result in some lost material and resources. 
- Feel free to drop me any ideas for mod changes/suggestions, or custom mod requests.
