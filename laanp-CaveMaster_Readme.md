----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mod Version: 1

Compatible with Icarus Version: Rev. 2.3.12.143251 (Week: 201)

## Description:
Mod that provides cave location information and support routines, including map markers for caves and dealing with cave entrances and creatures. 

## Mod Details:
- Works in single player mode, as well as hosted multiplayer & dedicated server environments.
- Works on all maps including Open Worlds, Missions and Outposts (including all DLC)
- Mod is accessible in the player crafting menu.
- Place the mod in your quickbar and select it, then LMB to activate the "Pete's Cave Master" menu. 
    - Search Grid Radius - Specify search distance (in map grids) for caves
    - Show Caves button - Shows nearby cave markers on the map (within specified search grid radius).  NOTE - Only an area of about 2 grid radius from the player will initially be revealed (plus bonus map markers throughout the map).  The mod remembers your last map reveal and is accumulated as you use the mod to show nearby caves.
    - Hide Caves button - Removes all cave markers on the map.
    - Show Cave Arrows checkbox - Displays/hides highly visible green arrows pointing to cave locations in the game. 
    - Remove Cave Creatures button - removes caveworms and cave bees
    - Open Nearby Cave button - Removes nearest cave blocked entrance to the player.
- Mod reveals many more caves that are not shown by other other cave reveal mods, including through-caves, hidden caves and cave entrances underwater! 
- Mod stores accumulated cave location data, and is map specific.  The more cave location info you map out with this mod, the more info is stored, and available for any other prospect using the same map.  
- All cave location data is stored in a file: C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Icarus\Saved\SaveGames\Petes_CaveMaster_<MapName>.sav 
- You can share this file with other players using this mod, so they can see the map locations you have revealed! 



## Installation Details

### Client (Local) machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

If you are playing multiplayer where one person is hosting, Use the exact same mods
on everyone's PC, or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the hosting player settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

### Dedicated Server machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server and client machine or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.
