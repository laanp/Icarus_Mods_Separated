## Installation Details

### Client (Local) machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

If you are playing multiplayer where one person is hosting, Use the exact same mods
on everyone's PC, or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the hosting player settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

### Dedicated Server machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server and client machine or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

## Disclaimer
I have been playing with these mods for quite some time now, with no problems... having said that:
- Backup and save all user data before installing or using any mods.
- Use at your own risk.
- This mod was designed as standalone, and may not be compatible with other mods.
- Ensure you are running the latest version of this mod with the latest version of Icarus.  Hint: the _w102_ in the mod file name means mod is compatible 
    with Week 102 Icarus release.  The _v1...2 etc in the mod file name refers to mod enhancements or fixes within the same week release. 
- This mod changes storage cabinets & bench inventory slot sizes.  
   If you fill all slots in these benches/storage cabinets on a prospect and return to it without these mods running, you will lose
   all those items in those additional slots. 
- Feel free to drop me any ideas for mod changes/suggestions.
