laanp-TeleFly_v1_w219_P.pak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mod Version: 1

Compatible with Icarus Version: Rev. 2.3.30.148457 (Week: 219)

## Description:
Provides ability for your player to fly around the map and teleport to pointed-to locations, within visible range. 

## Mod Details:
- This mod works in single player mode, as well as hosted multiplayer & dedicated server environments.
- Introduces a new craftable icon called "Petes TeleFly" which you can craft in the character inventory.
- This mod turns off all fall damage and out-of-bounds warnings/death!
- When placed in your Quickbar and activated, Use:
  - Tap LMB - To quick launch in any direction and sets player into "Fly" mode
  - Once in "Fly" mode, use movement keys & mouse pointer to direct flying player, or tap LMB to jump 600 units in any direction.
  - To teleport to a location (ground, building, etc), point the cursor to your destination and hold the LMB down (for 1 second).
  - When flying, tap RMB and wait a second to fall to the ground, and sets player back to normal walking mode.   
  - Holding RMB will stay in fly mode, but will stop all movement, so you are still in the air.
  - Holding LSHIFT + Forward key will fast accelerate your flying speed.
  - Hold Left-CRTL to lower quickly.
  - Hold Space bar to raise quickly.
  - Tap `R` key to teleport to cursor pointed to location, and move your player under the mesh and into fly mode.

## Mod Notes:
- Directional flying controls with mouse pointer, only works in first-person camera view!
- Sometimes strange player launch will happen after switching to camera view while flying, and exiting camera view!

## Installation Details

### Client (Local) machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

If you are playing multiplayer where one person is hosting, Use the exact same mods
on everyone's PC, or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the hosting player settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.

### Dedicated Server machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server and client machine or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.
