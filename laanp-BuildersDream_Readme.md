## Installation Details

### Client (Local) or Single Player machine:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

(drive):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

### Hosted Multiplayer or Dedicated Server:
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the dedicated server game mods folder typically located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

NOTE - Replace (drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\ with the applicable location you installed your Icarus Dedicated Server app.

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server (or hosted PC) and all client machines connected or else run the risk of weird stuff happening.
Usually the server settings/mods will override anything running on the local client machine(s), but match the mods to stay out of trouble.


## Known Bugs/Issues/Notes - As of this current release.
### This mod was designed as a bundled standalone mod that affects a number of files, and may not be compatible with Jimk72's Icarus Mod Manager (IMM).
This mod uses a variation of Jimk72's CustomOptions, Teleporter and Camera_Distance mods, so do not merge those mods with this one!! 
If installing with other mods using the IMM - SOME THINGS MAY NOT WORK! - You may have success merging with other mods using IMM, but do not report these issues as a bug unless you have tested this mod on it's own, with no other mods installed!
Refer to [laanp Mod Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/laanp/Icarus_Mods_Separated?tab=readme-ov-file#laanp_mod_compatibility_matrixpdf) for a x-ref of laanp mods that can be used together in the game.

### "Pete's Mining Kit"
For some reason there is a "Komodo Bite" modifier state showing, when you hover over the "Pete's Ore Extractor" and "Pete's Ice Borer" with your mouse cursor. 
This does not affect the player, and can be ignored.  All drills will function at higher speeds.

### Custom Options Interface:
- "Deactivate Cave Worms" only works in single player client mode. Does not work on Dedicated Server.
- "Extinguish Fire" - Does not work in single player client mode, or on Dedicated Server.
- "Clear Foliage" - Don't panic if you accidentally hit this and all your local flora is gone.  It only lasts for your current session.
- On Dedicated server (multiplayer), Turning on/off closest local fire, will only show for player who initiated it. 
- On Dedicated server (multiplayer), Turning on/off lights, will only show for player who initiated it.
- Turning lights and local Fire on/off may cause the game to freeze. Would recommend using in-game interface instead.

### Teleporter:  
There is a known issue where ocassionally, after you teleport back to a saved destination when you walk over the teleport pad, you will teleport 
and the screen will become pitch black.  Just activate the remote on your hotbar (remember the key), and teleport back to the teleport pad.  
The screen should correct itself, then step off the pad and walk back over it to retry the teleport to the saved location.  
It will usually work the 2nd time you try.

### "Pete's Resource Killer"
If you are using "Pete's Resource Killer" module (1 hit for tree, rocks and ore gathering) - it goes without saying if you are chopping a tree
with your axe, and do not have the Talent "Seasoned Logsman" - the one that auto picks up your wood, you'll end up with wood pieces all over
the place and not in your inventory!  This is expected behaviour.

### "Pete's Lava Cave Lord"
This module, when placed in your envirosuit auxilliary slot, provides immunity to damage from lava, fire, poison & cave pneumonia.
The afflictions will still show on your character status effects, however you will not take any damage. 

### FreeBuild
Basically you can craft anything you have unlocked in your Tech Tree.
Auto-craft benches will continuously craft for the first applicable ordered item in its inventory slots, until the bench inventory fills up!

### WorkshopFree
With this mod, you must have Red Exotics (DLC Content - New Frontiers) unlocked in your game to research/craft Workshop items that require Red Exotics. 
Red Exotics are unlocked with an entry in the Profile.json

### Equipment Retrieval
None of the unbundled equipment will come back with you after you leave the prospect via dropship. 
You need to purchase the kits at the Workshop, before launching any mission, Open World, or Outpost.
